// Package chgv implements values that track changes with a simple
// flag set of type 'change.Flags'. The flag(s) passed to any Set call
// are retuned if the underlying value changed. Otherwise 0 is
// returned. Note that if one passes flag=0 to Set the returned value
// will always be 0, which make it rather uninteresting. However this
// will not affect the actual value change.
//
// While these changeable values are rather bare bones they come
// without memory overhead â€“ unlike most observable libraries.
//
// Set Methods

// TODO: describe principle of Set methods.
