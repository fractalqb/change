// Flags is used by all Set methods to return to the caller if a Set
// operation did change a value. Generally Flags==0 means nothing
// changed.  The flags from different Set calls can efficiently be
// combined with the '|' binary or operator. However there is room for
// no more than 64 different flags.
//
// The specific flags for a call to Set are generally provided by the
// caller. It depends on the sub package what it means to pass 0 flags
// to a Set method. E.g. there may be defaults that kick in if one
// passes 0 flags to the actual call.
