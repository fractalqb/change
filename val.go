// Val implements values that track changes with a simple flag-set of
// type Flags. The flag(s) passed to any Set method call are retuned
// if the underlying value changed. Otherwise the passed value is not
// assigned and 0 is returned. Note that if one passes flag=0 to Set
// the returned value will always be 0, which makes it rather
// uninteresting. However this will not affect the actual value
// change.
//
// While these changeable values are rather bare bones they come
// without memory overhead â€“ unlike most observable libraries.
